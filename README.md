# Vision-Quest

Welcome to the Vision-Quest repository. This project includes two main features: a Snapchat-like filter using OpenCV and a balloon game using Pygame. It also covers the basics of image processing (arithmetic operations and logical operations) and video processing.

## Features

### Snapchat Filter

This feature uses OpenCV and cvzone to create a filter that can be applied to real-time video streams. The filter tracks hand movements and applies effects based on gestures.

### Balloon Game

This feature is a simple game built using Pygame. In the game, balloons appear on the screen, and the player needs to pop them using hand gestures detected through the webcam.

### Basics of Image Processing

The project demonstrates basic image processing techniques such as arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (bitwise AND, OR, NOT).

### Video Processing

The project includes examples of video processing using OpenCV, such as reading video files, capturing video from a webcam, and applying filters and transformations to video frames.
