# Vision-Quest

Welcome to the Vision-Quest repository. This project includes two main features: a Snapchat-like filter using OpenCV and a balloon game using Pygame.

## Features

### Snapchat Filter

This feature uses OpenCV and cvzone to create a filter that can be applied to real-time video streams. The filter tracks hand movements and applies effects based on gestures.

### Balloon Game

This feature is a simple game built using Pygame. In the game, balloons appear on the screen, and the player needs to pop them using hand gestures detected through the webcam.
